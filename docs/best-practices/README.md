## üéØ General Best Practices

### 1. Hardware Considerations

**Minimum Requirements**:
- CPU: Quad-core processor (Intel i5/AMD Ryzen 5 or better)
- RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- Storage: 10GB free space for installation, additional space for projects
- GPU: Optional but recommended for Stable Diffusion (NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM)

**Performance Tips**:
- Close unnecessary applications during video rendering
- Use an SSD for project files and cache
- Keep GPU drivers up to date for optimal performance
- Monitor system resources during generation

### 2. Provider Configuration

**Free vs Pro Providers**:
- Start with free providers (rule-based LLM, Windows TTS) to learn the system
- Upgrade to pro providers (OpenAI GPT, ElevenLabs) for higher quality
- Mix free and pro providers to balance cost and quality
- Configure fallback providers for reliability

**API Key Management**:
- Store API keys securely
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for development and production

### 3. Project Organization

**File Structure**:
```
Projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Templates/          # Reusable templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assets/            # Images, audio, video clips
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Images/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Video/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scripts/           # Video scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output/            # Rendered videos
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- Use descriptive names: `tutorial-intro-v1.mp4` not `video1.mp4`
- Include version numbers for iterations
- Use consistent date formats: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Avoid special characters in filenames

### 4. Quality Control

**Before Rendering**:
- Preview timeline and transitions
- Check audio levels and clarity
- Verify all assets are available
- Test with a short clip first

**During Rendering**:
- Monitor progress and logs
- Check for errors or warnings
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Don't interrupt the process

**After Rendering**:
- Review output quality
- Check audio/video sync
- Verify proper encoding
- Archive source files

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- Rendering fails: Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Poor quality: Adjust render settings or use better providers
- Slow performance: Reduce resolution or complexity
- Missing dependencies: Run dependency check

**Getting Help**:
- Check [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/Troubleshooting.md)
- Search existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Saiyan9001/aura-video-studio/issues)
- Provide logs and system information when reporting issues
- Use the [First Run FAQ](../getting-started/FIRST_RUN_FAQ.md) for common questions

## üîí Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable key rotation where supported
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

### Data Privacy
- Don't include personal information in scripts
- Review generated content before sharing
- Understand provider data policies
- Use local providers for sensitive content

### System Security
- Keep software updated
