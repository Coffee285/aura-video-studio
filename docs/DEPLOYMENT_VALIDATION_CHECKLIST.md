## Quick Commands Reference

### Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Full test suite
dotnet test

# Smoke tests only
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Smoke"

# Integration tests only
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration"

# Performance tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Performance"
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# System health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostics/health

# Configuration status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostics/configuration

# Run all diagnostics
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostics/run-integration-tests
```

### Provider Testing
```bash
# Test specific provider
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostics/test-provider \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"providerName":"RuleBased"}'

# Test quality analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/diagnostics/test-quality-analysis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"script":"Test script","topic":"Test","tone":"informative"}'
```

## Notes

- ✓ = Must complete before deployment
- ⚠️ = Complete if applicable to environment
- All automated tests should be run as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Manual verification steps should be documented with results
- Keep this checklist updated as system evolves
