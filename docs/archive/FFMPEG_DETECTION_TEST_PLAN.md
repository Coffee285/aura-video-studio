```json
{
  "success": true,
  "found": false,
  "ffmpegPath": null,
  "reason": "FFmpeg not found in any of X candidate locations",
  "attemptedPaths": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ],
  "howToFix": [
    "Install FFmpeg using the Install button",
    "Manually download FFmpeg and use 'Attach Existing'",
    "Place FFmpeg in .../dependencies/bin and click Rescan again"
  ]
}
```

#### 6.2 Attach API
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5005/api/downloads/ffmpeg/attach \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path":"/usr/bin/ffmpeg"}'
```

**Expected Response** (success):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "ffmpegPath": "/usr/bin/ffmpeg",

### Test 8: Open Folder Action

**Objective**: Verify "Open Folder" button works.

**Steps**:
1. Install or attach FFmpeg
2. Click "Open Folder" button
3. Verify:
