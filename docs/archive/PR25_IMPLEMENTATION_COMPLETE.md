## Key Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Weighted Decision History
Recent decisions weighted more heavily using exponential decay:
```
weight = exp(-daysSinceDecision / 90)
```

### 2. Pattern Strength Calculation
Combines three factors:
- **Statistical Significance**: Based on sample size (plateaus at 30 decisions)
- **Consistency**: How evenly distributed patterns are over time
- **Recency**: Exponential decay for old observations

```
strength = (significance √ó 0.4) + (consistency √ó 0.3) + (recency √ó 0.3)
```

### 3. Preference Confidence
Based on:
- Sample size (more decisions = higher confidence)
- Consistency rate (how often the same value appears)

```
confidence = (sampleScore √ó 0.4) + (consistencyScore √ó 0.6)
```

### 4. Acceptance Probability
Combines:
- Base acceptance rate from history
- Pattern strength adjustments
- Similar decision matching

### 5. Learning Maturity Levels
- **Nascent**: <20 decisions
- **Developing**: 20-50 decisions
- **Mature**: 50-100 decisions
- **Expert**: 100+ decisions
