# Timeline Editor Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a professional video timeline editor to Aura Video Studio, giving users Adobe Premiere-style control over their AI-generated videos. The editor provides scene preview, editing capabilities, asset management, and real-time preview generation.

## Architecture

### Backend (C# / .NET)

#### Models (`Aura.Core/Models/Timeline/TimelineModels.cs`)

**Core Types:**
- `AssetType` enum - Image, Video, Audio
- `Position` record - Asset position (X, Y, Width, Height as percentages)
- `EffectConfig` record - Visual effects (brightness, contrast, saturation, filter)
- `TimelineAsset` record - Assets within scenes with positioning and effects
- `TimelineScene` record - Scene with metadata, script, timing, assets, and transitions
- `SubtitleTrack` record - Subtitle configuration
- `EditableTimeline` class - Mutable timeline with manipulation methods
- `Timeline` record - Immutable timeline for rendering

**Key Methods in EditableTimeline:**
- `AddScene()` - Add scene to timeline
- `RemoveScene()` - Remove scene by index
- `ReorderScene()` - Move scene to new position
- `UpdateSceneDuration()` - Adjust scene length
- `ReplaceSceneAsset()` - Update asset in scene
- `AddAssetToScene()` - Add new asset
- `ToImmutableTimeline()` - Convert to immutable for rendering

#### Services (`Aura.Core/Services/Editor/TimelineRenderer.cs`)

**TimelineRenderer Class:**
- `GeneratePreviewAsync()` - Low-res (720p) preview generation
- `GenerateFinalAsync()` - Full-quality final render
- `BuildFilterComplex()` - Generate FFmpeg filter chain
- `BuildSceneComposite()` - Composite assets within scene
- `BuildAudioMix()` - Mix narration and background music

**FFmpeg Integration:**
- Uses `filter_complex` for sophisticated video composition
- Scales and positions assets based on percentages
- Applies opacity and visual effects
- Handles transitions between scenes
- Mixes audio tracks with proper timing
- Reports progress via `IProgress<int>`
- Supports cancellation via `CancellationToken`

#### API (`Aura.Api/Controllers/EditorController.cs`)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}` - Load timeline from job artifacts
- `PUT /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}` - Save timeline changes
- `POST /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}/render-preview` - Generate preview video
- `POST /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}/render-final` - Generate final high-quality video
- `POST /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}/assets/upload` - Upload image/video assets
- `DELETE /api/editor/timeline/{jobId}/assets/{assetId}` - Remove asset
- `GET /api/editor/preview/{jobId}` - Stream preview video
- `GET /api/editor/video/{jobId}` - Stream final video

**Validation:**
- Ensures all asset files exist
- Validates scene durations
- Checks timeline structure integrity

### Frontend (React / TypeScript)

- "Edit Video" button on completed jobs in RecentJobsPage

**State Management:**
- React hooks for local state
- Dirty state tracking
- Auto-save mechanism
- Error handling

## Usage Flow

1. User generates video through Quick Demo or Create Wizard
2. Job completes successfully
3. User clicks "Edit Video" button on job card
4. Timeline editor loads with scenes from job
5. User can:
   - Edit scene headings and scripts
   - Adjust scene durations
   - Configure transitions
   - Import and position assets
   - Apply visual effects
6. Changes auto-save every 5 seconds
7. User clicks "Generate Preview" to see edited video
8. Preview renders and displays in player
9. User can generate final high-quality render
10. Final video available for download

## Technical Details

### Timeline Data Flow

1. **Job Creation**: Scenes generated during video creation
2. **Timeline Initialization**: `EditorController.GetTimeline()` creates timeline from job artifacts
3. **Editing**: User modifies timeline in browser
4. **Auto-Save**: PUT requests save timeline.json to job directory
5. **Rendering**: POST requests trigger FFmpeg rendering with timeline data
6. **Preview**: Low-res video generated quickly for review
7. **Final**: High-quality video with all edits applied

### FFmpeg Rendering Process

1. Parse timeline scenes and assets
2. Build filter complex:
   - Create blank video for each scene duration
   - Scale and position assets
   - Apply effects (brightness, contrast, opacity)
   - Overlay assets by z-index
   - Apply transitions between scenes
3. Mix audio tracks:
   - Narration audio per scene
   - Background music
   - Volume normalization
4. Execute FFmpeg with progress tracking
5. Output video to job directory

### Asset Management

- Assets stored in job's `assets/` subdirectory
- Unique GUID filenames prevent conflicts
- Multipart upload handling
- File validation (images and videos only)
- Referenced by file path in timeline

- ✅ Asset property adjustment (position, size, opacity, z-index)
- ✅ Visual effects (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- ✅ Transition configuration
- ✅ Preview generation
- ✅ Final rendering
- ✅ Auto-save
- ✅ Professional video player controls

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Add drag-and-drop library for intuitive scene reordering
2. Implement edge dragging with visual feedback
3. Add scene thumbnails generation
4. Show audio waveforms for narration tracks
5. Add snap-to-grid with 0.5s intervals
6. Implement undo/redo history
7. Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
8. Show real-time preview updates without re-rendering
9. Add timeline ruler with time markers
10. Support for multiple visual asset tracks

### Integration Enhancements
1. Export timeline as project file
2. Import timeline from external sources
3. Batch asset import
4. Asset library with search
5. Preset transitions and effects
6. Template scenes

## Security Considerations

- File uploads validated by type
- Asset paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- Timeline data validated before saving
- FFmpeg arguments properly escaped
- File operations use safe path joining
- Multipart uploads limited by size

## Performance Considerations

- Preview renders at 720p for speed
- Auto-save debounced to 5 seconds
- Timeline loaded lazily on editor open
- Video streaming uses range requests
- FFmpeg progress reported for user feedback
- Asset thumbnails could be cached (future)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate video with Quick Demo
2. Open timeline editor from job list
3. Verify timeline loads with scenes
4. Edit scene properties and verify save
5. Generate preview and verify playback
6. Test video player controls
7. Import asset and adjust properties
8. Generate final render and verify quality
9. Test auto-save by making changes and waiting
10. Verify unsaved changes warning on navigation

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for timeline editing in Aura Video Studio. The architecture is extensible and follows best practices for both backend and frontend development. While some advanced features like drag-and-drop would benefit from additional libraries, the current implementation covers all core requirements and provides a professional editing experience.
