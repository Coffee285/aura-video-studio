# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the Aura Video Studio project. These files are preserved for reference but are not actively maintained.

## What's Archived Here

### Implementation Notes (Agent & PR Summaries)
Historical implementation summaries created during development by various agents and pull requests. These document:
- Feature implementations
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring work
- Integration work

### Verification & Testing Documentation
Checklists and test results from completed work:
- Acceptance criteria
- Verification checklists
- Test results
- Manual testing procedures

### Before/After Comparisons
Documentation showing changes made during various fixes and improvements.

### Completion Summaries
Documentation marking completion of major features or milestones.

### PR & Change Summaries
Historical PR summaries documenting changes merged into the codebase.

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during active development to:
1. Track implementation progress
2. Document decisions made
3. Verify completion of work
4. Provide context for changes

They are now archived because:
- The work described is complete
- The features documented are now part of the main codebase
- Current documentation in other sections supersedes these historical notes
- They serve as historical reference rather than active documentation

## Note

If you're researching how a specific feature was implemented or why certain decisions were made, these archived documents may provide valuable historical context.
