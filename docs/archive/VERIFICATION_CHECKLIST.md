## Testing Requirements (Not Yet Done)

### Manual Testing Required Before Merge
- [ ] **Quick Demo End-to-End**
  ```
  1. Start API: cd Aura.Api && dotnet run
  2. Start Web: cd Aura.Web && npm run dev
  3. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
  4. Click "Quick Demo (Safe)" button
  5. Verify:
     - Button shows loading state
     - Console logs: POST /api/quick/demo
     - Response: { jobId: "...", status: "queued" }
     - Backend logs: [Job xxx] Updated: Status=Running...
     - Progress updates every 2 seconds
     - Job completes: Status=Done, Percent=100%
     - MP4 file created and playable
  ```

- [ ] **Manual Video Creation End-to-End**
  ```
  1. Navigate to Create page
  2. Fill in topic, audience, duration, pacing
  3. Click through steps 1-3
  4. Run preflight check (may show warnings)
  5. Click "Generate Video"
  6. Verify same as Quick Demo
  7. Confirm MP4 file created
  ```

- [ ] **SSE Streaming Test**
  ```
  1. Start a job (Quick Demo or manual)
  2. Open browser DevTools > Network tab
  3. Check for connection to /api/jobs/{id}/stream
  4. Verify event stream shows:
     - event: connected
     - event: progress (multiple)
     - event: complete
  5. Note: Frontend may still use polling (not SSE yet)
  ```

- [ ] **Logging Verification**
  ```
  1. Start API with: cd Aura.Api && dotnet run
  2. Watch logs: tail -f Aura.Api/logs/aura-api-*.log
  3. Start a job
  4. Verify logs show:
     - Job creation
     - Status transitions
     - Stage changes
     - Percent updates
     - Completion
  ```

- [ ] **Error Handling Test**
  ```
  1. Start job with invalid topic (empty string)
  2. Verify error message shown
  3. Check logs for error details
  4. Confirm job marked as Failed
  ```

### Automated Testing (Future)
- [ ] Unit tests for JobRunner.UpdateJob
- [ ] Integration tests for /api/jobs endpoint
- [ ] Integration tests for /api/quick/demo endpoint
- [ ] E2E tests for Quick Demo workflow
- [ ] E2E tests for manual creation workflow
- [ ] SSE connection tests

## Success Criteria Checklist

### Must Have (Before Merge)
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [x] Changes are minimal and surgical
- [ ] Quick Demo creates actual MP4 file
- [ ] Manual creation creates actual MP4 file
- [ ] Progress updates visible in UI
- [ ] Logs show complete execution trace

### Should Have (Can Fix Later)
- [ ] SSE actually used by frontend (currently polling)
- [ ] GenerationPanel integrated with CreatePage
- [ ] Toast notifications instead of alerts
- [ ] Preflight checks test real functionality
- [ ] Better error messages

### Nice to Have (Future PRs)
- [ ] E2E test suite
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Progress bar animations
- [ ] Retry failed jobs button
- [ ] Job cancellation works

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **SSE Endpoint Not Used Yet**
   - SSE endpoint implemented at `/api/jobs/{jobId}/stream`
   - Frontend still uses polling (every 2 seconds)
   - Polling works fine, SSE is optimization
   - Future: Update `useJobsStore` to use EventSource

2. **CreatePage Shows Alert Instead of Panel**
   - Success shows alert() with job ID
   - Quick Demo opens GenerationPanel automatically
   - Future: Navigate to jobs page or open GenerationPanel

3. **Preflight May Show False Positives**
   - Checks if FFmpeg exists, not if it works
   - Checks if providers configured, not if they're valid
   - Future: Actually execute test commands

4. **No Automatic UI Updates**
   - User must manually check jobs page
   - Future: Add status bar notification
   - Future: Auto-open GenerationPanel on completion

## Security Review ✅

### Code Analysis
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ No SQL injection risks (no SQL queries added)
- ✅ No XSS risks (no HTML rendering)
- ✅ No path traversal (using ArtifactManager)
- ✅ No command injection (no shell execution in changes)
- ✅ Proper cancellation token handling
- ✅ Exception handling in place
- ✅ Correlation IDs for tracing

### SSE Security
- ✅ No authentication bypass
- ✅ Connection timeout set (via CancellationToken)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Resource cleanup on disconnect
- ✅ No infinite loops (checks job status)

### Input Validation
- ✅ JobsController validates request
- ✅ Brief, PlanSpec validated by models
- ✅ No direct user input to file system
- ✅ Job IDs are GUIDs (not user-controlled)

## Performance Review ✅

### SSE Endpoint
- ✅ Polls every 2 seconds (not too aggressive)
- ✅ Stops when job complete (no infinite polling)
- ✅ Cleanup on client disconnect
- ✅ No memory leaks (local variables only)

### JobRunner
- ✅ Background execution (Task.Run)
- ✅ Async/await used correctly
- ✅ Cancellation token support
- ✅ Proper disposal of resources

### Frontend
- ✅ Existing polling at 2 seconds unchanged
- ✅ No new memory leaks
- ✅ Console logging won't hurt production
- ✅ Error handling prevents stuck states

- Need to verify progress updates appear

### High Risk ❌
- None identified
