# First-Run Wizard Detection Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements proper first-run detection using persistent storage to check if the application has been launched before, and automatically routes to the onboarding wizard when no prior launch is detected.

## Problem Solved
- Application did not automatically launch the first-run wizard on initial startup
- Users were taken directly to the main application instead of being guided through setup
- First-run detection was inconsistent and not properly persisted

## Solution Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### 1. firstRunService.ts (New)
A centralized service for managing first-run detection with dual persistence:

**Key Functions:**
- `hasCompletedFirstRun()` - Async check of both localStorage and backend
- `getLocalFirstRunStatus()` - Fast local check with backward compatibility
- `setLocalFirstRunStatus()` - Updates both new and legacy keys
- `markFirstRunCompleted()` - Marks completion in both localStorage and backend
- `resetFirstRunStatus()` - Clears all flags for testing/re-running
- `migrateLegacyFirstRunStatus()` - Automatic migration from old key

**Storage Strategy:**
- Primary key: `hasCompletedFirstRun`
- Legacy key: `hasSeenOnboarding` (for backward compatibility)
- Backend persistence: `/api/settings/first-run` endpoint

#### 2. App.tsx Updates
**Before:** Routes loaded immediately, WelcomePage handled redirection
**After:** 
- Checks first-run status on mount before rendering routes
- Shows loading spinner during check
- Conditionally redirects root route to /onboarding for first-time users
- Prioritizes onboarding route in route definitions

**New Flow:**
```
App Mount → Check First Run → [Loading] → Decision
                                          ↓
                            First Run? → /onboarding
                                   ↓
                            Not First Run? → / (WelcomePage)
```

#### 3. FirstRunWizard.tsx Updates
- Replaced direct localStorage calls with service methods
- Completion handlers now call `markFirstRunCompleted()`
- Entry check uses `getLocalFirstRunStatus()`
- Maintains all existing wizard functionality

#### 4. SettingsPage.tsx Enhancement
Added "Reset First-Run Wizard" button in System settings tab:
- Confirmation dialog before reset
- Calls `resetFirstRunStatus()` service method
- Redirects to /onboarding after reset
- Useful for testing and troubleshooting

#### 5. WelcomePage.tsx Simplification
- Removed redundant first-run check (now in App.tsx)
- Simplified useEffect to only fetch system info
- Cleaner component with single responsibility

### Backend Components

#### SettingsController.cs Endpoints

**1. GET /api/settings/first-run**
```csharp
Returns: FirstRunStatus {
  hasCompletedFirstRun: bool,
  completedAt: string,
  version: string
}
```

**2. POST /api/settings/first-run**
```csharp
Body: FirstRunStatus
Returns: { success: true, message: "..." }
```

**3. POST /api/settings/first-run/reset**
```csharp
Returns: { success: true, message: "First-run status reset successfully" }
```

**Storage Location:** `AuraData/first-run-status.json`

## Testing

### Unit Tests (11 tests, all passing)
**File:** `Aura.Web/src/test/firstRunService.test.ts`

Test Coverage:
- ✅ getLocalFirstRunStatus with no keys
- ✅ getLocalFirstRunStatus with new key
- ✅ getLocalFirstRunStatus with legacy key  
- ✅ getLocalFirstRunStatus preferring new over legacy
- ✅ setLocalFirstRunStatus to true
- ✅ setLocalFirstRunStatus to false
- ✅ migrateLegacyFirstRunStatus migration
- ✅ migrateLegacyFirstRunStatus not overwriting
- ✅ migrateLegacyFirstRunStatus with no legacy
- ✅ resetFirstRunStatus clearing localStorage
- ✅ resetFirstRunStatus handling backend errors

### E2E Tests Updated
- `first-run-wizard.spec.ts` - Updated to clear both keys
- `onboarding-path-pickers.spec.ts` - Updated to clear both keys

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:

1. **Legacy Key Support:** Checks `hasSeenOnboarding` if `hasCompletedFirstRun` not found
2. **Automatic Migration:** Migrates legacy key to new key on first check
3. **Dual Writes:** Sets both keys on completion for older code paths
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Works without backend (localStorage only)

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `Aura.Web/src/App.tsx` (enhanced routing logic)
- `Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx` (service integration)
- `Aura.Web/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (reset button)
- `Aura.Web/src/pages/WelcomePage.tsx` (simplified)
- `Aura.Web/tests/e2e/first-run-wizard.spec.ts` (updated keys)
- `Aura.Web/tests/e2e/onboarding-path-pickers.spec.ts` (updated keys)

### Frontend (New Files)
- `Aura.Web/src/services/firstRunService.ts` (new service)
- `Aura.Web/src/test/firstRunService.test.ts` (unit tests)

### Backend
- `Aura.Api/Controllers/SettingsController.cs` (new endpoints + model)

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Fresh Install Auto-Routes:** On completely fresh install with no prior data, application automatically routes to first-run wizard

✅ **Persistent Flag:** Wizard completion sets persistent flag preventing wizard from showing again

✅ **Subsequent Launches:** Subsequent launches go directly to main application

✅ **Reset Capability:** Settings panel includes option to reset/re-run wizard for testing

✅ **Cross-Session Persistence:** First-run detection works across browser sessions and page refreshes

✅ **Cross-Device Persistence:** Backend storage enables detection across devices/reinstalls

## How to Test

### Scenario 1: First-Time User
1. Clear localStorage and backend data
2. Navigate to application
3. ✅ Should automatically redirect to `/onboarding`
4. Complete wizard
5. ✅ Should redirect to `/create` or `/` based on completion choice
6. Refresh page
7. ✅ Should stay on main app, not redirect to onboarding

### Scenario 2: Existing User
1. Already has `hasSeenOnboarding=true` in localStorage
2. Navigate to application
3. ✅ Should load main app
4. ✅ Key should auto-migrate to `hasCompletedFirstRun`

### Scenario 3: Reset Wizard
1. Go to Settings → System tab
2. Click "Reset First-Run Wizard"
3. Confirm dialog
4. ✅ Should redirect to `/onboarding`
5. ✅ Both localStorage keys cleared
6. ✅ Backend status cleared

### Scenario 4: Manual Navigation
1. Complete first-run wizard
2. Try to manually navigate to `/onboarding`
3. ✅ Should redirect to `/` (already completed)

## Build Status

- ✅ Frontend build: SUCCESS
- ✅ Backend build: SUCCESS  
- ✅ Unit tests: 11/11 PASSING
- ✅ Linter: No new errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors

## Notes

- The loading spinner ensures smooth UX during first-run check
- Backend errors don't block functionality (localStorage is fallback)
- Service uses optimistic approach: either source showing completion = completed
- All console errors/warnings are for diagnostic purposes only
- Implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase
