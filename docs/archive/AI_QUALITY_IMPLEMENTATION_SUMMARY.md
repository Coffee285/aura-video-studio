```

#### 2. Intelligent Content Advisor (`Aura.Core/AI/IntelligentContentAdvisor.cs`)

**Purpose**: Validates content quality through dual-layer analysis

**Analysis Methods**:

1. **Heuristic Analysis** (Fast, Deterministic):
   - AI pattern detection (common phrases, structures)
   - Generic phrase identification
   - Repetitive structure detection
   - Specificity scoring
   - Pacing and rhythm analysis

2. **AI-Powered Analysis** (Deep, Contextual):
   - Authenticity assessment
   - Engagement evaluation
   - Value determination
   - Pacing validation
   - Originality scoring

**Quality Metrics**:
```csharp
public class ContentQualityAnalysis
{
    public double OverallScore { get; set; }          // Composite 0-100
    public double AuthenticityScore { get; set; }     // Human-sounding
    public double EngagementScore { get; set; }       // Holds attention
    public double ValueScore { get; set; }            // Useful content
    public double PacingScore { get; set; }           // Natural flow
    public double OriginalityScore { get; set; }      // Avoids clichés
    public List<string> Issues { get; set; }          // Specific problems
    public List<string> Suggestions { get; set; }     // Improvements
    public List<string> Strengths { get; set; }       // What works
    public bool PassesQualityThreshold { get; set; }  // Gate decision
}
```

#### 3. Updated LLM Providers

All major LLM providers now use the enhanced prompt system:

**Updated Providers**:
- `OpenAiLlmProvider`: GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini
- `OllamaLlmProvider`: Local LLMs (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- `AzureOpenAiLlmProvider`: Azure-hosted OpenAI models
- `GeminiLlmProvider`: Google Gemini Pro

**Changes Made**:
- Removed legacy simple prompt methods
- Integrated `EnhancedPromptTemplates` for system and user prompts
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Improved logging for quality tracking

- Rewards specific numbers and data
- Checks for proper nouns and references
- Validates concrete examples

#### Pacing Analysis
Validates natural flow:
- Calculates sentence length variation
- Checks coefficient of variation
- Identifies monotonous or erratic patterns
- Recommends rhythm improvements

## Usage Examples

### 1. Enhanced Script Generation

```csharp
// Initialize provider with enhanced prompts
var provider = new OpenAiLlmProvider(logger, httpClient, apiKey, "gpt-4o-mini");

// Create brief and plan
var brief = new Brief(
    Topic: "AI Video Creation Tips",
    Audience: "Content Creators",
    Goal: "Education",
    Tone: "conversational",
    Language: "en",
    Aspect: Aspect.Widescreen16x9
);

var planSpec = new PlanSpec(
    TargetDuration: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
    Pacing: Pacing.Conversational,
    Density: Density.Balanced,
    Style: "Educational"
);

// Generate high-quality script
var script = await provider.DraftScriptAsync(brief, planSpec, cancellationToken);

// Script now uses enhanced prompts automatically
// Result: More natural, engaging, specific content
```

### 2. Content Quality Validation

```csharp
// Initialize advisor
var advisor = new IntelligentContentAdvisor(logger, llmProvider);

// Analyze script quality
var analysis = await advisor.AnalyzeContentQualityAsync(
    script, 
    brief, 
    planSpec, 
    cancellationToken
);

// Check results
if (analysis.PassesQualityThreshold)
{
    _logger.LogInformation(
        "Quality check passed! Score: {Score:F1}", 
        analysis.OverallScore
    );
    
    // Proceed with video generation
    await GenerateVideoAsync(script);
}
else
{
    _logger.LogWarning(
        "Quality issues detected. Score: {Score:F1}", 
        analysis.OverallScore
    );
    
    // Log issues for review
    foreach (var issue in analysis.Issues)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Issue: {Issue}", issue);
    }
    
    // Log suggestions
    foreach (var suggestion in analysis.Suggestions)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Suggestion: {Suggestion}", suggestion);
    }
    
    // Option 1: Regenerate with feedback
    // Option 2: Present issues to user
    // Option 3: Proceed anyway (user override)
}
```

### 3. Quality Metrics Reporting

```csharp
// Get detailed quality breakdown
var metrics = new
{
    Overall = analysis.OverallScore,
    Authenticity = analysis.AuthenticityScore,
    Engagement = analysis.EngagementScore,
    Value = analysis.ValueScore,
    Pacing = analysis.PacingScore,
    Originality = analysis.OriginalityScore
};

// Display to user or log
_logger.LogInformation(
    "Quality Metrics - Overall: {Overall:F1}, " +
    "Authenticity: {Auth:F1}, Engagement: {Eng:F1}, " +
    "Value: {Val:F1}, Pacing: {Pac:F1}, Originality: {Orig:F1}",
    metrics.Overall, metrics.Authenticity, metrics.Engagement,
    metrics.Value, metrics.Pacing, metrics.Originality
);

// Store for trend analysis
await _metricsStore.SaveMetricsAsync(projectId, metrics);
```
