# Provider Mixer Guaranteed Fallbacks - Implementation Summary

## Problem
"Error generating script: No LLM providers available" error could occur even when guaranteed fallback providers (RuleBased, Windows SAPI, Slideshow) should be available.

## Root Cause
The issue had two failure points:

1. **LlmProviderFactory**: If RuleBased provider creation failed during factory initialization, it would not be added to the providers dictionary. The error was logged but swallowed.

2. **ScriptOrchestrator**: The final fallback to RuleBased checked `_providers.ContainsKey("RuleBased")` before attempting to use it. If RuleBased wasn't in the dictionary (due to #1), the fallback would never be attempted.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced LlmProviderFactory (Aura.Core/Orchestrator/LlmProviderFactory.cs)
- Added a two-tier fallback mechanism for RuleBased provider creation:
  - **Primary**: Uses reflection-based factory method `CreateRuleBasedProvider()`
  - **Fallback**: If primary fails, attempts direct instantiation via assembly scanning
- Changed logging level from `LogError` to `LogCritical` for RuleBased creation failures
- Added specific logging to track when fallback instantiation is used

### 2. Fixed ScriptOrchestrator (Aura.Core/Orchestrator/ScriptOrchestrator.cs)
- **Removed** the `_providers.ContainsKey("RuleBased")` check from final fallback logic
- Now **always** attempts RuleBased as the ultimate fallback, even if not in providers dictionary
- The existing dynamic instantiation in `TryGenerateWithProviderAsync` (lines 154-212) will create RuleBased if needed
- Added critical error logging when even RuleBased fallback fails

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage (Aura.Tests/ProviderMixerTests.cs)
Added 5 new test methods covering edge cases:

1. **SelectLlmProvider_Should_ReturnRuleBasedForAllTiers_WhenNoProvidersAvailable**
   - Tests Pro, ProIfAvailable, Free, empty string, and null tiers
   - Verifies RuleBased is returned with correct fallback metadata

2. **SelectTtsProvider_Should_ReturnWindowsForAllTiers_WhenNoProvidersAvailable**
   - Tests Pro, ProIfAvailable, and Free tiers
   - Verifies Windows TTS is returned as guaranteed fallback

3. **SelectVisualProvider_Should_ReturnSlideshowForAllTiers_WhenNoProvidersAvailable**
   - Tests Pro, ProIfAvailable, Free, and StockOrLocal tiers
   - Verifies Slideshow is returned as guaranteed fallback

4. **SelectLlmProvider_Should_PreferHigherTierWhenAvailable**
   - Tests that Pro tier is preferred when all providers are available
   - Verifies OpenAI is selected (highest priority Pro provider)

5. **SelectLlmProvider_Should_FollowFallbackChain_ProTier**
   - Tests the complete fallback chain: OpenAI → Azure → Gemini → Ollama → RuleBased
   - Verifies each level of fallback works correctly
   - Confirms RuleBased is returned even with empty provider dictionary

## Fallback Chains

### LLM Providers
- **Pro tier**: OpenAI → Azure → Gemini → Ollama → **RuleBased** (guaranteed)
- **ProIfAvailable**: OpenAI → Azure → Gemini → Ollama → **RuleBased** (guaranteed)
- **Free tier**: Ollama → **RuleBased** (guaranteed)
- **Empty providers**: **RuleBased** (guaranteed - never throws)

### TTS Providers
- **Pro tier**: ElevenLabs → PlayHT → Mimic3 → Piper → **Windows** (guaranteed)
- **ProIfAvailable**: ElevenLabs → PlayHT → Mimic3 → Piper → **Windows** (guaranteed)
- **Free tier**: Mimic3 → Piper → **Windows** (guaranteed)
- **Empty providers**: **Windows** (guaranteed - never throws)

### Visual Providers
- **Pro tier**: Stability → Runway → StableDiffusion (if NVIDIA 6GB+) → Stock → **Slideshow** (guaranteed)
- **ProIfAvailable**: Stability → Runway → StableDiffusion (if NVIDIA 6GB+) → Stock → **Slideshow** (guaranteed)
- **StockOrLocal**: StableDiffusion (if NVIDIA 6GB+) → Stock → **Slideshow** (guaranteed)
- **Free tier**: Stock → **Slideshow** (guaranteed)
- **Empty providers**: **Slideshow** (guaranteed - never throws)

## Offline Mode Handling
Offline mode is handled at the API/Orchestrator level, **before** provider selection:
- When `offlineOnly=true` and tier is "Pro", returns error E307
- When `offlineOnly=true` and tier is "ProIfAvailable", downgrades to "Free" tier
- ProviderMixer then selects from available offline-compatible providers (Ollama, RuleBased)

## Test Results
All 22 ProviderMixer tests pass:
```
Passed!  - Failed:     0, Passed:    22, Skipped:     0, Total:    22, Duration: 91 ms
```

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ ProviderMixer **always** resolves to a working provider when any fallback exists
✅ Comprehensive unit tests added to prevent regressions  
✅ Fallback chain correctly implements: Pro → Free → Guaranteed (RuleBased/Windows/Slideshow)
✅ Downgrade reasons are tracked in `ProviderSelection.FallbackFrom` and `ProviderSelection.Reason`
✅ Logging added for UI display of downgrade messages

## Migration Notes
No breaking changes. This is a bug fix that makes the system more resilient. Existing code continues to work as before, but now handles edge cases where provider creation fails.
