- ✅ Ripple delete removes scene and closes gap automatically
- ✅ Delete without ripple leaves gap that can be manually closed
- ✅ Mute and solo buttons work correctly excluding tracks from output
- ✅ Volume and pan controls adjust audio levels and stereo position
- ✅ VU meters show real-time audio levels during preview playback
- ✅ Timeline snapping works for playhead, scene edges, and grid lines
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work for all major operations
- ✅ Spacebar toggles play/pause without focus issues
- ✅ J/K/L shuttle controls work with progressive speed increase
- ✅ Copy/paste works within timeline and between timelines
- ✅ Duplicate creates identical scene immediately after original
- ✅ Zoom slider and presets smoothly change timeline scale
- ✅ Zoom around playhead keeps playhead at same screen position
- ✅ Mousewheel zoom with Cmd/Ctrl works naturally
- ✅ Performance remains smooth with 100+ scenes
- ✅ Waveforms render without blocking UI
- ✅ Playhead animation is smooth without stuttering
- ✅ Undo/redo works for all editing operations up to 50 steps back
