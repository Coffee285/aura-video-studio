## Video Generation Workflows

### 1. Demo Video Generation (QuickService)

**Purpose:** One-click video generation with guaranteed success

**Configuration:**
- **Duration:** 10-15 seconds (locked)
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 @ 30fps (locked)
- **Codec:** H.264 (locked for maximum compatibility)
- **Providers:** Free-only (RuleBased LLM, Windows/Null TTS, Stock visuals)
- **Style:** "Demo"
- **Pacing:** Fast
- **Density:** Sparse

**Workflow:**
1. Create Brief with safe defaults
2. Create PlanSpec with 12-second target duration
3. Create VoiceSpec (Windows TTS preferred)
4. Create RenderSpec locked to 1080p30 H.264
5. Submit to JobRunner for background execution
6. Return job ID immediately

**Use Case:** First-time users, testing, demonstrations

### 2. Normal Video Generation (VideoOrchestrator)

**Purpose:** Full-featured video generation with custom settings

**Two Modes:**

#### Smart Orchestration (with SystemProfile)
- Analyzes system capabilities (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- Selects optimal generation strategy
- Parallel task execution with dependency management
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Automatic recovery from failures

#### Fallback Orchestration (without SystemProfile)
- Sequential stage-by-stage execution
- Script → Audio → Assets → Composition → Render
- Simpler but still robust
- Used when system profile unavailable

**Customizable Options:**
- Duration: Any length (typically 30 seconds to 10+ minutes)
- Resolution: 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K
- Frame rate: 24fps, 30fps, 60fps
- Quality level: 0-100
- Codec: H.264, H.265 (if available)
- Audio bitrate: 128-320 kbps
- Video bitrate: 2000-15000 kbps
- Provider selection: Free, Balanced, Pro-Max profiles

**Workflow:**
1. Pre-generation validation (FFmpeg, disk space, system requirements)
2. Stage 1: Script generation via LLM with validation
3. Stage 2: Scene parsing and timing calculation
4. Stage 3: Audio generation via TTS with validation and fallback
5. Stage 4: Asset generation (images, if applicable)
6. Stage 5: Video composition and rendering via FFmpeg
7. Progress reporting throughout via SSE
8. Resource cleanup on completion or failure

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Recovery Logic in VideoGenerationOrchestrator

**Issue:**
The `AttemptRecoveryAsync` method was returning `true` after the first successful task recovery, even if there were multiple failed tasks. This meant only one failed task would be retried.

**Location:**
`Aura.Core/Services/Generation/VideoGenerationOrchestrator.cs`, line 313

**Before:**
```csharp
foreach (var failed in failedTasks)
{
    // ... retry logic ...
    return true; // ❌ Returns after first success
}
return false;
```

**After:**
```csharp
bool anyRecovered = false;
foreach (var failed in failedTasks)
{
    // ... retry logic ...
    anyRecovered = true; // ✅ Tracks any recovery
}
return anyRecovered;
```

**Impact:**
- Critical tasks (script, audio, composition) now all get retry attempts
- Better resilience for scenarios with multiple failures
- More consistent recovery behavior

**Test Coverage:**
Added to existing `OrchestrateGenerationAsync_WithFailingTask_ShouldHandleFailure` test.

## Test Enhancements
