# Quick Demo Verification Guide

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for verifying the Quick Demo flow on a clean Windows installation. Follow these steps to ensure the first-run experience works correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Clean Windows 10/11 installation (virtual machine recommended)
- No dependencies installed (no FFmpeg, no .NET Runtime, etc.)
- 4 GB RAM minimum
- 2 GB free disk space
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)

## Test Environment Setup

### Option 1: Virtual Machine (Recommended)
1. Create a new Windows 10/11 VM in VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V
2. Allocate at least 4 GB RAM and 20 GB disk space
3. Install a web browser (Edge is pre-installed on Windows 10/11)
4. Do NOT install any development tools or runtimes

### Option 2: Clean Machine
1. Use a physical machine with fresh Windows installation
2. Ensure no development tools are installed
3. Verify no FFmpeg, .NET Runtime, or other dependencies exist

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Extract the Portable Distribution

1. **Download** the portable ZIP:
   - From GitHub Releases: `AuraVideoStudio_Portable_x64.zip`
   - Or from build artifacts: `artifacts/portable/AuraVideoStudio_Portable_x64.zip`

2. **Extract** to a test location:
   ```
   Recommended locations:
   - C:\Aura
   - D:\Tools\AuraVideoStudio
   - Desktop\AuraTest
   ```

3. **Verify** the extracted structure:
   ```
   AuraVideoStudio_Portable_x64/
   ├── Api/
   │   ├── Aura.Api.exe
   │   └── wwwroot/
   ├── Tools/           (empty initially)
   ├── AuraData/
   ├── Logs/            (empty initially)
   ├── Projects/        (empty initially)
   ├── Downloads/       (empty initially)
   ├── ffmpeg/          (may be empty if not pre-bundled)
   ├── start_portable.cmd
   ├── README.md
