# üéâ Issue FIXED - Aura Video Studio is Now Working!

## What Was Wrong

You were experiencing a **404 error** when trying to access the Web UI at http://127.0.0.1:5005. The error logs showed:

```
[23:39:42 INF] Content root path: C:\TTS\aura-video-studio-main\artifacts\portable\build
[23:39:44 INF] Request finished HTTP/1.1 GET http://127.0.0.1:5005/ - 404 0 null 190.2459ms
```

## What I Fixed

### ‚úÖ Fix #1: Launcher Script Working Directory

**The Problem:**
The `Launch.bat` script was starting the API like this:
```batch
start "" "Api\Aura.Api.exe"
```

This launched the executable but didn't change the working directory to the `Api` folder. So when the API looked for `wwwroot`, it looked in the wrong place:
- **Looking for:** `C:\...\build\wwwroot\` ‚ùå (doesn't exist)
- **Should look in:** `C:\...\build\Api\wwwroot\` ‚úÖ (correct location)

**The Solution:**
I changed the launcher to use the `/D` flag which sets the working directory:
```batch
start "" /D "Api" "Aura.Api.exe"
```

Now the API runs from the `Api` folder and finds `wwwroot` correctly!

### ‚úÖ Fix #2: API Endpoint Routing

**The Problem:**
Your Web UI was trying to call:
- `/api/healthz`
- `/api/capabilities`
- etc.

But the API was serving them at:
- `/healthz`
- `/capabilities`
- etc.

This caused the Web UI to fail loading system information.

**The Solution:**
I added a route group with `/api` prefix to all endpoints in `Aura.Api/Program.cs`:
```csharp
var apiGroup = app.MapGroup("/api");
apiGroup.MapGet("/healthz", ...);
apiGroup.MapGet("/capabilities", ...);
// All 16 endpoints updated
```

Now the Web UI and API match perfectly!

### ‚úÖ Fix #3: Documentation

I created `BUILD_AND_RUN.md` with:
- Complete build instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Expected console output
- How to verify everything works

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Get the Latest Code

```powershell
cd C:\TTS\aura-video-studio-main
git pull origin main
# Or download the latest code from GitHub
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the Application

```powershell
.\scripts\packaging\build-portable.ps1
```

This will create a fresh build with all the fixes applied.

### Step 3: Extract and Run

```powershell
# Clean up old build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force artifacts\portable\build -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Extract the new ZIP
Expand-Archive artifacts\portable\AuraVideoStudio_Portable_x64.zip -DestinationPath C:\TTS\aura-test

# Run it
cd C:\TTS\aura-test
.\Launch.bat
```

### Step 4: Verify Success

**In the API console window, you should see:**
```
[INF] Serving static files from: C:\TTS\aura-test\Api\wwwroot ‚úÖ
[INF] Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:5005
[INF] Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

**Key success indicator:** The first line says "Serving static files" - NOT "wwwroot directory not found"!

**In your browser:**
- The page should load automatically at http://127.0.0.1:5005
- You should see the Welcome page with:
  - "API is healthy" with green "Online" badge
  - Your hardware info (CPU threads, RAM)
  - Features available status

## Screenshots of Working Application

The 3-step wizard for creating videos is fully functional!

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

1. **Make sure you rebuilt with the latest code:**
   ```powershell
   git status
   # Should show you're on the latest commit
   ```

2. **Check the directory structure:**
   ```powershell
   tree /F C:\TTS\aura-test
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   C:\TTS\aura-test\
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Api\
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Aura.Api.exe
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wwwroot\
   ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets\
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Launch.bat
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ```

3. **Check the Launch.bat file:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\TTS\aura-test\Launch.bat
   ```
   
   It should contain:
   ```batch
   start "" /D "Api" "Aura.Api.exe"
   ```
   
   If it says `start "" "Api\Aura.Api.exe"` without the `/D`, you have an old build.

### API Says "wwwroot directory not found"?

This means you're using an old build. Delete everything and rebuild:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\TTS\aura-test
.\scripts\packaging\build-portable.ps1
Expand-Archive artifacts\portable\AuraVideoStudio_Portable_x64.zip -DestinationPath C:\TTS\aura-test
```

### Port 5005 Already In Use?

If you have multiple instances running:

```powershell
# Find processes using port 5005
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5005 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Kill any old Aura.Api.exe processes
Get-Process Aura.Api -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

Then try running again.

## What Works Now

‚úÖ **Static file serving** - Web UI loads correctly  
‚úÖ **All API endpoints** - Health, capabilities, script generation, TTS, render, etc.  
‚úÖ **System detection** - CPU, RAM, GPU, NVENC, Stable Diffusion detection  
‚úÖ **Web UI pages** - Welcome, Dashboard, Create, Render, Publish, Downloads, Settings  
‚úÖ **Create wizard** - 3-step video creation workflow  
‚úÖ **Form validation** - Required fields, dropdowns, all working  
‚úÖ **Navigation** - All pages accessible and functional  

## Start Creating Videos!

Now that it's working, you can:

1. **Click "Create Video"**
2. **Enter a topic** (e.g., "How to make perfect coffee")
3. **Choose your settings:**
   - Audience: General/Beginners/Advanced/Professionals
   - Tone: Informative/Casual/Professional/Energetic
   - Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (YouTube), 9:16 (Shorts), 1:1 (Instagram)
4. **Click "Next"** to set duration and pacing
5. **Click "Generate Video"**

The app will use:
- **Free script generation** (rule-based templates)
- **Free TTS** (Windows built-in voices)
- **FFmpeg** for video rendering

No API keys required for the basic workflow!
