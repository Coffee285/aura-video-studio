### 3. Hardware Acceleration ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**Verification**: The hardware acceleration detection was already fully implemented:
- Backend: `Aura.Core/Hardware/HardwareDetector.cs`
- Backend: `Aura.Api/Controllers/DiagnosticsController.cs` - `/api/diagnostics/hardware` endpoint
- Frontend: `Aura.Web/src/services/hardwareService.ts` - Detection service
- Frontend: `Aura.Web/src/pages/VideoEditorPage.tsx` - Loads hardware info
- Frontend: `Aura.Web/src/components/Export/ExportDialog.tsx` - Displays hardware status

Features:
- Detects NVIDIA NVENC, AMD AMF, Intel Quick Sync
- Displays GPU acceleration status in export dialog
- Adjusts render time estimates based on hardware availability
- Fallback to software encoding if no GPU available

## What Was Already Implemented (Before This PR)

From the existing codebase (documented in EXPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md and EXPORT_SUMMARY.md):

1. **ExportDialog Component** - Full UI with platform presets
2. **Export API Endpoints** - Start, status, cancel, active jobs, presets
3. **FFmpeg Integration** - Video rendering service
4. **Export Presets** - 11 platform-specific presets (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
5. **Progress Tracking** - Integration with global activity footer
6. **Export Queue** - Sequential processing of multiple exports
7. **Error Handling** - Graceful failures with detailed messages
8. **Database Schema** - `ExportHistoryEntity` model and migration

## Implementation Complete

All export functionality features have been implemented except for email notifications, which have been explicitly excluded from the project scope as they require email service infrastructure that is not needed for the application.

### Timeline Rendering Service ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Timeline rendering has been fully integrated with the export functionality.

Implementation details:
- Modified `ExportController.StartExport()` to accept optional timeline data in `ExportRequestDto`
- Timeline data is rendered using the existing `TimelineRenderer` service before being exported
- Temporary files are created in `/tmp/aura-exports/` for timeline renders
- `RenderSpec` is automatically created from the export preset settings
- Frontend (`VideoEditorPage.tsx`) builds timeline data from current clips and sends it to the export API
- Timeline scenes are constructed from timeline clips with proper formatting for TimeSpan values
- Export workflow now supports both:
  1. Direct file export (using `inputFile` parameter)
  2. Timeline-based export (using `timeline` parameter)

Changes made:
- **Backend**: 
  - `Aura.Api/Controllers/ExportController.cs`: Added timeline rendering before export
  - `ExportRequestDto`: Made `InputFile` optional, added `Timeline` property
- **Frontend**:
  - `Aura.Web/src/services/exportService.ts`: Added timeline type definitions
  - `Aura.Web/src/pages/VideoEditorPage.tsx`: Added `buildTimelineForExport()` function to convert clips to timeline format
  - Removed placeholder input file, now sends actual timeline data

### Email Notifications - REMOVED FROM SCOPE

**Decision**: Email notification functionality has been intentionally excluded from this project.

**Reason**: Email notifications do not make sense for this application as:
- Users are actively working in the UI during export
- Export progress is already shown in the global activity footer
- Desktop notifications are available for long-running exports
- Adding email infrastructure would be unnecessary complexity

All references to email notifications have been removed from:
- Implementation plans
- Future feature documentation
- Code comments

## API Changes Summary

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/export/history?status=<status>&limit=<limit>`
  - Returns export history from database
  - Supports optional filtering by status
  - Default limit of 100 records

### Modified Methods
- `ExportOrchestrationService.QueueExportAsync()` - Now persists to database
- `ExportOrchestrationService.ProcessJobAsync()` - Updates database during processing

## Database Changes

- **Table**: `export_history` (already existed)
- **Behavior**: Now actively used for persistence
  - Jobs saved on queue
  - Status updated on start
  - Progress/completion saved on finish
  - Errors saved on failure

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Export History Page**
   - Navigate to `/export-history`
   - Verify table displays with correct columns
   - Test re-export button
   - Test download button for completed exports
   - Test loading states
   - Test error handling

2. **Advanced Settings**
   - Open export dialog
   - Expand "Advanced Settings" accordion
   - Change codec selection
   - Enter custom bitrate
   - Enter custom resolution
   - Verify export options include advanced settings

3. **Database Persistence**
   - Start an export
   - Verify job appears in database immediately
   - Check status updates during processing
   - Verify completion is saved to database
   - Check export history page shows the job

4. **Hardware Detection**
   - Open export dialog
   - Verify hardware status badge appears
   - Check GPU information is accurate
   - Verify render time estimates adjust for hardware

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for `ExportOrchestrationService` database operations
- Integration tests for export history API endpoint
- Component tests for `ExportHistoryPage`
- E2E tests for complete export workflow

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Queries**
   - Export history queries limited to 100 records by default
   - Indexed on status and created_at for fast filtering
   - Pagination ready (though not yet implemented in UI)

2. **Memory Usage**
   - In-memory job queue still exists for active jobs
   - Database used for historical persistence
   - Consider cleanup job for old exports (>30 days)

3. **API Response Times**
   - Export history endpoint should be fast (<100ms)
   - Database query is simple SELECT with ORDER BY
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Advanced settings validated before export starts
   - Custom bitrate/resolution ranges should be enforced
   - File path sanitization for output files

2. **Database Access**
   - Export history filtered by user (if multi-tenant)
   - SQL injection prevented by EF Core parameterization
   - No sensitive data stored in export history

3. **File Downloads**
   - Download links should validate file ownership
   - Prevent directory traversal attacks
   - Consider signed URLs for temporary access

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Build Status**: ✅ 0 errors, warnings only (analyzer suggestions)
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Type checking passes
- **ESLint**: ✅ 0 errors in new files
- **Lines Added**: ~725 lines of new code (including timeline integration)
- **Files Created**: 2 (ExportHistoryPage.tsx, formatters.ts)
- **Files Modified**: 6 (ExportController.cs, ExportOrchestrationService.cs, exportService.ts, ExportDialog.tsx, App.tsx, VideoEditorPage.tsx)
