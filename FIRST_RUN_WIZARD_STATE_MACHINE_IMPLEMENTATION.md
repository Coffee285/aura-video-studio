# First-Run Wizard State Machine Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation fixes the stuck validate button and implements a deterministic state machine for the First-Run Wizard to ensure users can complete onboarding without getting trapped in any state.

## Problem Statement
- After validating, UI still said "Click Next to validate settings"; button remained blue "Validate" and never advanced
- State machine didn't transition; user trapped
- No clear path to fix validation failures

## Solution

### A. Frontend State Machine

#### 1. State Management (`Aura.Web/src/state/onboarding.ts`)

**State Machine Definition:**
```
Idle → Validating → Valid/Invalid → Installing → Installed → Ready
```

**States:**
- `idle`: Initial state, waiting for user to click Validate
- `validating`: Running preflight checks
- `valid`: Validation passed, ready to advance
- `invalid`: Validation failed, showing fix actions
- `installing`: Installing dependencies/engines
- `installed`: Installation complete
- `ready`: All set, wizard complete

**Key Features:**
- Deterministic state transitions via reducer
- CorrelationId tracking for validation requests
- Failed stage tracking with actionable fix information
- Hardware detection state management
- Install item tracking with progress state

**Button Label Mapping:**
| Status | Label |
|--------|-------|
| Idle | "Validate" (last step) or "Next" |
| Validating | "Validating…" |
| Valid | "Next" |
| Invalid | "Fix Issues" |
| Installing | "Installing…" |
| Installed | "Validate" |
| Ready | "Continue" |

**State Transitions:**
- `START_VALIDATION` → status: validating
- `VALIDATION_SUCCESS` → status: valid (stores report and correlationId)
- `VALIDATION_FAILED` → status: invalid (stores failed stages)
- `START_INSTALL` → status: installing
- `INSTALL_COMPLETE` → status: installed
- `MARK_READY` → status: ready
- `RESET_VALIDATION` → status: idle

#### 2. Component Integration (`Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Replaced multiple useState hooks with useReducer
- Integrated state machine for button labels and disabled states
- Added auto-advance when validation succeeds
- Implemented inline Fix CTAs for failed validation
- Added handleFixAction for actionable fixes:
  - Install: Navigate to downloads page
  - Start: Show service start instructions
  - OpenSettings: Navigate to settings with specific tab
  - SwitchToFree: Switch to free alternative
  - Help: Open help URL

**Auto-Advance Logic:**
- When validation succeeds on final step, automatically mark as ready
- Button label changes from "Validate" → "Validating…" → "Next" → "Continue"
- No more getting stuck after successful validation

**Fix Actions Display:**
- Shows failed stages with:
  - Stage name (Script, TTS, Visuals)
  - Provider that failed
  - Error message
  - Hint for fixing
  - Suggestions list
  - Quick fix action buttons

### B. Backend Updates

#### 1. PreflightController (`Aura.Api/Controllers/PreflightController.cs`)

**Changes:**
- Added optional `correlationId` query parameter
- Generates UUID if correlationId not provided
- Adds `X-Correlation-Id` header to response
- Enhanced logging with correlation IDs for request tracking

**Example Request:**
```
GET /api/preflight?profile=Free-Only&correlationId=validation-1234567890-abc123
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "stages": [
    {
      "stage": "Script",
      "status": "pass",
      "provider": "RuleBased",
      "message": "Rule-based script generation available"
    }
  ]
}
```

Headers: `X-Correlation-Id: validation-1234567890-abc123`

#### 2. PreflightService

**Already Implemented:**
- Machine-friendly status per requirement (pass/warn/fail)
- Actionable fix actions (Install, Start, OpenSettings, SwitchToFree, Help)
- Clear reasons and suggestions for failures
- Stage-by-stage validation

### C. Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests (`Aura.Web/src/state/__tests__/onboarding.test.ts`)

**37 Test Cases:**
- State transitions (SET_STEP, SET_MODE, SET_STATUS)
- Validation flow (START_VALIDATION → SUCCESS/FAILED)
- Hardware detection (START → DETECTED/FAILED)
- Installation flow (START_INSTALL → COMPLETE/FAILED)
- Button label mapping for all states
- Button disabled logic
- Can advance step logic
- Complete state machine flows

**Coverage:**
- Idle → Validating → Valid → Ready flow
- Idle → Validating → Invalid flow
- Idle → Installing → Installed flow
- Error handling and recovery

#### 2. E2E Tests (`Aura.Web/tests/e2e/first-run-wizard.spec.ts`)

**8 Test Cases:**
1. Complete wizard flow with Free-Only mode and successful validation
2. Show fix actions when validation fails
3. Allow user to go back and change mode
4. Disable buttons during validation
5. Allow skipping setup
6. Show step progress indicator
7. Not show wizard if already completed
8. Validate button states throughout flow

**Test Coverage:**
- Happy path: Mode selection → Hardware → Install → Validate → Complete
- Error path: Validation failure → Show fix actions → Retry
- Navigation: Back/forward through steps
- State persistence: localStorage integration
- Button states: Disabled during async operations
- Skip flow: Direct navigation to home

### D. UI/UX Improvements

#### Before:
- Button always said "Next" or "Validate"
- No indication of validation progress
- No clear path when validation failed
- User could get stuck after validation

#### After:
- Button label reflects current state (Validating…, Fix Issues, etc.)
- Spinner shown during async operations
- Clear error messages with fix actions
- Auto-advance on successful validation
- Can retry validation after fixing issues

## Test Results

**Unit Tests:** ✅ 97 passed (37 new onboarding tests + 60 existing)
**Build:** ✅ Successful TypeScript compilation
**No TypeScript Errors:** ✅ Zero errors or warnings

## Manual Verification Steps

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   cd Aura.Web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear localStorage to simulate first run**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('hasSeenOnboarding')
   ```

3. **Navigate to `/onboarding`**

4. **Test Happy Path (Free-Only)**
   - Select Free-Only mode
   - Click Next through steps
   - On validation step, click "Validate"
   - Button should show "Validating…" with spinner
   - After success, should show "All Set!" screen
   - Button should change to "Continue" or success actions

5. **Test Error Path (Pro Mode without API keys)**
   - Select Pro Mode
   - Navigate to validation step
   - Click "Validate"
   - Should show "Validation Failed" with fix actions
   - Should show "Add API Key" button
   - Should show suggestions and hints

6. **Test Navigation**
   - Click Back button at any step
   - Verify state is preserved
   - Change mode and continue

7. **Test Skip**
   - Click "Skip Setup" button
   - Should navigate to home page

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **useReducer over useState**
   - More predictable state transitions
   - Single source of truth
   - Easier to test and debug
   - Better for complex state logic

2. **Thunks for Async Operations**
   - Encapsulates async logic
   - Dispatches multiple actions
   - Better error handling
   - Reusable across components

3. **CorrelationId Tracking**
   - Ties frontend requests to backend logs
   - Better debugging and monitoring
   - Can track validation across distributed systems

4. **Inline Fix Actions**
   - Actionable CTAs based on failure type
   - Reduces user confusion
   - Clear path to resolution
   - Links directly to relevant pages

5. **Auto-Advance on Success**
   - Reduces user friction
   - Clear success state
   - No ambiguity about next step
   - Better UX flow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Persistence**
   - Save wizard progress to localStorage
   - Resume from last step
   - Don't lose progress on page refresh

2. **Validation Retry with Backoff**
   - Automatic retry on network errors
   - Exponential backoff
   - Better error recovery

3. **Real-time Status Updates**
   - WebSocket or polling for install progress
   - Live validation status
   - Better feedback during long operations

4. **Advanced Hardware Detection**
   - GPU compute capability
   - RAM availability
   - Disk space checks
   - More accurate recommendations

5. **Telemetry**
   - Track wizard completion rate
   - Identify common failure points
   - A/B test different flows
   - Improve based on data

## Conclusion

This implementation delivers a robust, deterministic state machine for the First-Run Wizard that ensures users never get stuck and always have a clear path forward. The state machine handles all edge cases, provides clear feedback, and offers actionable solutions when validation fails.
