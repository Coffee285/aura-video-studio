- ✅ Initialization order verification

**ci.yml** - Full CI pipeline:
- ✅ Backend build and test
- ✅ Frontend tests with coverage
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests
- ✅ Bundle size verification
- ✅ Source map validation

### 5. Infrastructure & Observability ✅

#### Health Endpoints
Implemented in `Aura.Api/Controllers/HealthController.cs` and `Aura.Api/Program.cs`:
- ✅ `/api/health/live` - Liveness probe (returns 200 when app is running)
- ✅ `/api/health/ready` - Readiness probe (returns 200 when all services initialized)
- ✅ `/api/health/providers` - Provider health metrics
- ✅ `/api/health/providers/summary` - Aggregated health summary

#### Dependency Detection
- ✅ Script: `scripts/check-deps.sh` - Cross-platform validation
- ✅ Service: `Aura.Web/src/services/dependencyChecker.ts`
- ✅ API Endpoints:
  - `/api/dependencies/check`
  - `/api/dependencies/rescan`
  - `/api/dependencies/install/ffmpeg`

#### Service Initialization
- ✅ Orchestrator with ordered startup sequence
- ✅ Graceful degradation for optional dependencies
- ✅ Structured startup logging
- ✅ Initialization order tracking via `/api/diagnostics/initialization-order`

### 6. Documentation ✅

#### Core Documentation
- ✅ `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md` - Updated with validation results
- ✅ `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` - Complete dependency manifest
- ✅ `docs/ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md` - Startup diagnostics guide
- ✅ `docs/FFmpeg_Setup_Guide.md` - Installation instructions

#### Troubleshooting Guides
The `ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md` includes:
- ✅ Service initialization order documentation
- ✅ Health check procedures
- ✅ Diagnostic procedures (5 standard procedures)
- ✅ Common issues and resolutions
- ✅ Log analysis guidance

## Issues Fixed in This PR

### Test Compilation Errors
Fixed enum references that were using outdated values:

**File**: `Aura.Tests/ValidationTests.cs`
- Changed `Pacing.Standard` → `Pacing.Conversational` (4 occurrences)
- Changed `PauseStyle.Balanced` → `PauseStyle.Natural` (3 occurrences)

**File**: `Aura.Tests/TrendingTopicsServiceTests.cs`
- Added missing `using Aura.Core.Models;` directive to resolve `Brief` and `PlanSpec` types

**Impact**: All .NET projects now build without errors
