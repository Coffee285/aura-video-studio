# Portable-Only Cleanup - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation enforces a portable-only distribution policy for Aura Video Studio by removing all MSIX/EXE packaging infrastructure and adding CI guards to prevent their reintroduction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cleanup Scripts Created

#### `scripts/cleanup/portable_only_cleanup.ps1` (PowerShell)
- Searches for and removes forbidden packaging files
- Supports dry-run mode for preview
- Comprehensive file pattern matching
- Clear progress reporting

#### `scripts/cleanup/portable_only_cleanup.sh` (Bash)
- Linux/macOS compatible version
- Same functionality as PowerShell version
- Executable permissions set
- Duplicate file handling via associative arrays

#### `scripts/cleanup/ci_guard.sh` (CI Enforcement)
- Runs in CI pipeline to enforce policy
- Checks for forbidden file patterns
- Scans workflows for MSIX/EXE references
- Fails build if violations detected

### 2. Files Removed

- **`scripts/packaging/setup.iss`** - Inno Setup installer script
- **`Aura.App/Package.appxmanifest`** - MSIX package manifest

### 3. CI Workflows Updated

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Removed `build-winui-app` job (WinUI 3/MSIX build)
- Added `portable-only-guard` job
- Simplified to core build and test

#### `.github/workflows/ci-windows.yml`
- Removed MSBuild and MSIX packaging steps
- Added portable ZIP build step
- Added `portable-only-guard` job
- Updated artifact uploads

#### `.github/workflows/ci-linux.yml`
- Added `portable-only-guard` job
- Maintains existing Linux build/test

### 4. Documentation Updated

#### `README.md`
- Added "Distribution Policy" section
- Updated packaging references
- Clarified portable-only approach

#### `scripts/packaging/README.md`
- Added distribution policy at top
- Removed MSIX/EXE references
- Focused on portable ZIP only

#### `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Updated Windows CI description
- Replaced MSIX/EXE sections with portable-only
- Added cleanup scripts documentation
- Updated CI/CD pipeline description

#### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Removed production MSIX/EXE scenarios
- Updated directory structure
- Simplified technology stack table
- Added distribution policy note

#### `scripts/cleanup/README.md` (New)
- Complete cleanup scripts documentation
- Usage examples for all scripts
- CI integration details
- Troubleshooting guide

## Distribution Policy

**Aura Video Studio follows a portable-only distribution model:**

✅ **Supported:**
- Portable ZIP - Self-contained, no-install distribution

❌ **Not Supported:**
- MSIX/APPX packages
- Traditional installers (EXE/Inno Setup)
- Windows Store submissions

## Benefits

1. **No Installation Required** - Extract and run
2. **No Administrator Rights** - Runs from any directory
3. **No System Changes** - No registry or system file modifications
4. **Maximum Compatibility** - Works on any Windows system
5. **Easy Distribution** - Single ZIP file
6. **Easy Updates** - Replace files in place
7. **Portable** - Can run from USB drives or network shares

## CI Guard Operation

The CI guard runs on every push and pull request to ensure policy compliance:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup/ci_guard.sh
```

**Checks performed:**
1. Scans for forbidden file patterns (*.iss, *.msix*, *.appx*, etc.)
2. Checks scripts/packaging/ for forbidden directories
3. Searches workflows for MSIX/EXE references

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Clean (CI passes)
- `1` - Violations found (CI fails with detailed report)

## Testing

All cleanup scripts and CI guards have been tested with:
- ✅ Dry-run mode verification
- ✅ File deletion functionality
- ✅ Duplicate file handling
- ✅ CI guard detection accuracy
- ✅ YAML syntax validation
- ✅ Workflow compatibility

## Usage

### Run Cleanup (if needed)

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted
./scripts/cleanup/portable_only_cleanup.sh --dry-run

# Actually delete forbidden files
./scripts/cleanup/portable_only_cleanup.sh
```

### Verify Compliance

```bash
# Check for policy violations
./scripts/cleanup/ci_guard.sh
```

### Build Portable Distribution

```powershell
# Windows
.\scripts\packaging\build-portable.ps1
```

## Future Maintenance

The portable-only policy is now enforced automatically:
- CI guard runs on every build
- Violations cause build failures
- Clear error messages guide remediation
- Documentation clearly states policy

No manual intervention needed - the CI guard ensures compliance.

## Definition of Done

✅ Repository contains no MSIX/EXE packaging files  
✅ CI guard active and functional  
✅ All documentation updated  
✅ All tests passing  
✅ Workflows validated  

**Status: COMPLETE**
