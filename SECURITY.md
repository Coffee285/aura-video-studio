# Security Policy

## Overview

Aura Video Studio is committed to maintaining the security and integrity of our application. This document outlines our security practices, policies, and procedures.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **Preferred Method**: Use GitHub's Security Advisory feature
   - Go to Repository → Security → Advisories → New draft security advisory
   - This keeps the vulnerability private until it's addressed
2. **Alternative**: Contact the maintainers privately (do not open public issues)
3. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability and steps to reproduce

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation
- All public APIs validate input parameters
- Null checks on critical parameters
- Type validation for user inputs
- Path traversal prevention
- URL validation for external resources

### 2. File System Security
- SHA-256 checksum verification for file integrity
- Safe file operations with proper error handling
- Temporary file cleanup
- Proper file permission checks
- No exposure of sensitive file paths in user-facing error messages

### 3. Network Security
- HTTP client timeout configurations
- Proper disposal of HTTP resources
- HTTPS recommended for all external communications
- SSL certificate validation enabled
- Cancellation token support to prevent resource exhaustion

### 4. Process Security
- Process execution with `CreateNoWindow = true`
- Standard output/error redirection for controlled execution
- Timeout mechanisms for process execution
- Proper process disposal

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- API key validation for external service providers
- Secure storage recommendations for credentials
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets in source code

### 6. Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks in critical paths
- Proper disposal of resources using `using` statements
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting (sensitive data excluded)
- User-friendly error messages without information disclosure

## Security Analysis

This project undergoes regular security analysis using:
- **CodeQL**: Automated security vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Review**: Manual security-focused code reviews

For detailed security summaries of specific features and implementations, see [docs/security/](docs/security/).

## Best Practices

✅ Input validation on all public methods  
✅ Proper error handling and logging  
✅ Resource disposal with `using` statements  
✅ Cancellation token support  
✅ Timeout mechanisms for long-running operations  
✅ Secure file operations  
✅ No hardcoded credentials or secrets  
✅ Thread-safe operations  

## Compliance

The implementation follows:
- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- Microsoft .NET Security Guidelines
- Industry best practices for desktop application security

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all external URLs use HTTPS
2. **Certificate Validation**: Keep SSL certificate validation enabled
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper access control for application directories
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API operations
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable audit logging for sensitive operations
6. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update dependencies and runtime versions

## Security Audit History

All security audits and implementation-specific security reviews are documented in [docs/security/](docs/security/).
