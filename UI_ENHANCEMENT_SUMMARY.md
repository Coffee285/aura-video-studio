# UI Enhancement & Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This PR addresses the issue: "Web UI loads but interface is ugly. Text runs together, no dark mode, FFmpeg installation doesn't work. Make better interface, add dark mode, and add code for features."

## 🎯 Problem Statement Addressed

### Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ **Poor UI Styling** - Text running together, cramped layout
2. ✅ **No Dark Mode** - Only light theme available
3. ✅ **Non-functional Features** - FFmpeg install button didn't do anything
4. ✅ **Missing Backend Integration** - UI appeared to work but had no real functionality

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. Dark Mode (Complete)
- **Theme Toggle** - Button in sidebar to switch between light and dark themes
- **Persistence** - Theme preference saved to localStorage
- **Full Coverage** - All pages and components respect theme

- **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear sections with subtitles
- **Consistent Design** - All pages follow same patterns

### 3. Download Manager (Complete & Functional)
- **DependencyManager Integration** - Connected to API
- **Real Installation** - Actually downloads and installs FFmpeg and Ollama
- **Status Checking** - Shows installed/not installed state
- **Progress Feedback** - Visual indicators during installation
- **Error Handling** - Proper error messages and retry capability

### 4. API Key Management (Complete & Functional)
- **Secure Storage** - Keys stored in local app data
- **Masking** - Only first 8 characters shown when loaded
- **Multi-Provider Support** - OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Pexels, Stability AI

- **Validation** - Proper input validation

### 5. Enhanced Page Layouts (Complete)
All pages updated with:

- **Responsive Design** - Works on different screen sizes

## 📁 Files Modified

### Web UI (Aura.Web)
- `src/index.css` - Improved global styles
- `src/App.tsx` - Added theme context and dark mode
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Added theme toggle button
- `src/pages/WelcomePage.tsx` - Already had good layout

### API (Aura.Api)
- `Program.cs` - Added DependencyManager service and endpoints:
  - `GET /api/downloads/manifest` - Get dependency list
  - `GET /api/downloads/{component}/status` - Check if installed
  - `POST /api/downloads/{component}/install` - Install component
  - `POST /api/apikeys/save` - Save API keys
  - `GET /api/apikeys/load` - Load API keys (masked)

## 🚀 What Actually Works Now

### Downloads Page
1. Click "Install" next to FFmpeg
2. API receives request
3. DependencyManager downloads from GitHub
4. File is verified with SHA256
5. Status updates to "Installed"
6. Button becomes disabled

### Settings > API Keys
1. Enter API keys for services
2. Click "Save API Keys"
3. Keys stored in AppData/Local/Aura/apikeys.json
4. Reload page - keys appear masked (sk-test1...)
5. Can update and resave

### Dark Mode
1. Click "Dark Mode" button in sidebar
2. Theme switches instantly
3. Preference saved to localStorage
4. Persists across page reloads and sessions

## 📝 Notes

### What's Not Included (Out of Scope)
- OAuth implementation for YouTube publishing
- Actual video rendering (requires FFmpeg to be installed first)
- Project persistence (would need database)
- Real-time progress streaming for downloads

### Future Enhancements
- WebSocket support for real-time download progress
- Toast notifications instead of alerts
- Advanced settings for each provider
- Project history and management
- Export/import settings

## 🎉 Conclusion
