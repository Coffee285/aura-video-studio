# First-Run Wizard Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the first-run wizard to address the issues reported in the problem statement.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ❌ **Original Problem: Simulated Installation**
The wizard claimed to install FFmpeg successfully but didn't actually install anything - it was just simulating installation with a 2-second timeout.

**Root Cause:** `installItemThunk` in `Aura.Web/src/state/onboarding.ts` contained:
```typescript
// Simulate installation (in real app, this would call the download API)
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
```

### ✅ **Solution: Real Installation**
Replaced simulation with actual API calls:
```typescript
// Call the actual download API
const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
});
```

### 2. ❌ **Original Problem: No Default Path Information**
Users had no idea where components would be installed or where to find them after installation.

### ✅ **Solution: Display Default Paths**
Added default path information to each install item:
- FFmpeg: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\ffmpeg`
- Ollama: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\ollama`
- Stable Diffusion WebUI: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\stable-diffusion-webui`

These paths are displayed directly in the wizard UI, so users know exactly where to find their installations.

### 3. ❌ **Original Problem: No Installation Verification**
After "installing", there was no verification that the installation succeeded or that the component was actually available.

### ✅ **Solution: Status Detection & Verification**
- Auto-detect already installed components when entering the installation step
- Verify installation status after API calls complete
- Check `/api/downloads/ffmpeg/status` to confirm installation
- Update UI state based on actual installation results

### 4. ❌ **Original Problem: Poor Error Feedback**
If installation failed, users had no clear indication of what went wrong.

### ✅ **Solution: Enhanced Error Display**
- Show installation errors prominently with red background
- Display specific error messages from the API
- Provide helpful error context and suggestions

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **Aura.Web/src/state/onboarding.ts**
   - Replaced `installItemThunk` simulation with real API calls
   - Added `checkInstallationStatusThunk` to verify installation status
   - Added `checkAllInstallationStatusesThunk` to check all components
   - Enhanced `OnboardingState` interface to include `description` and `defaultPath` fields
   - Updated `initialOnboardingState` with descriptions and default paths for all items

2. **Aura.Web/src/components/Onboarding/InstallItemCard.tsx**
   - Added display of component descriptions
   - Added display of default installation paths
   - Added "Installed" badge when component is successfully installed
   - Added installation progress message ("Installing... This may take a few minutes")
   - Enhanced placeholder text in "Use Existing" dialog with contextual examples
   - Updated `InstallItem` interface to include `description` and `defaultPath` fields

3. **Aura.Web/src/pages/Onboarding/FirstRunWizard.tsx**
   - Added `useEffect` hook to check installation status when entering step 2
   - Imported `checkAllInstallationStatusesThunk` for status verification
   - Added installation options guide explaining Install/Use Existing/Skip
   - Added prominent error display section showing installation failures
   - Enhanced tips and guidance throughout the wizard

4. **Aura.Web/src/state/__tests__/onboarding.test.ts**
   - Added test to verify install items have descriptions
   - Added test to verify install items have default paths
   - Ensured all 42 tests continue to pass

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. Click "Install" → Shows spinner for 2 seconds → Says "success"
2. No idea where FFmpeg was "installed" (because it wasn't)
3. Validation fails because FFmpeg isn't actually installed
4. No helpful guidance on what to do next

### After
1. Click "Install" → Shows "Installing... This may take a few minutes"
2. Actually downloads and installs FFmpeg to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\ffmpeg`
3. Shows "Installed" badge when complete
4. Validation succeeds because FFmpeg is actually installed
5. Clear guidance on installation options and default paths

## Visual Improvements

### Step 2: Install Required Components

**Information Displayed:**
- Component name with "Required" badge if mandatory
- Description explaining what the component does
- Default installation path (e.g., `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\ffmpeg`)
- "Installed" badge when installation is complete
- Progress message during installation
- Three clear options: Install, Use Existing, Skip

**Guidance Section:**
```
📌 Installation Options

For each component, you have three options:
• Install: Automatically download and install to the default location shown above
• Use Existing: If you already have it installed, point Aura to its location
• Skip: Skip optional components (you can install them later from the Downloads page)
```

**Error Display:**
If installation fails, a red card appears showing:
```
⚠️ Installation Errors
• Failed to install ffmpeg: [specific error message]
```

## Technical Details

### Installation Flow

1. **User clicks "Install"**
   - `installItemThunk('ffmpeg', dispatch)` is called
   - State changes to `installing: true`
   - UI shows spinner and "Installing..." message

2. **API Call**
   - `POST http://127.0.0.1:5005/api/downloads/ffmpeg/install`
   - Request body: `{ mode: 'managed' }`
   - Waits for download and installation to complete

3. **Verification**
   - After successful installation, checks `GET /api/downloads/ffmpeg/status`
   - Verifies that FFmpeg is actually installed and accessible
   - Logs status for debugging

4. **State Update**
   - On success: `INSTALL_COMPLETE` action dispatched
   - State changes to `installed: true, installing: false`
   - UI shows "Installed" badge and hides install button

5. **Error Handling**
   - On failure: `INSTALL_FAILED` action dispatched
   - Error message added to `state.errors`
   - UI shows error in red card
   - Installation button remains available for retry

### Auto-Detection

When entering Step 2 (Installation), the wizard automatically checks if components are already installed:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (state.step === 2) {
    checkAllInstallationStatusesThunk(dispatch);
  }
}, [state.step]);
```

This prevents redundant installations and properly reflects the current state of the system.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Verify install items have descriptions (new)
- ✅ Verify install items have default paths (new)
- ✅ Test installation state transitions (existing)
- ✅ Test error handling (existing)
- ✅ Test button labels for all states (existing)
- ✅ All 42 tests pass

### Security
- ✅ CodeQL scan: 0 security issues found
- ✅ No vulnerabilities introduced

### Build
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build successful
- ✅ .NET API build successful

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation significantly improves the wizard experience, potential future improvements could include:

1. **Progress Tracking**: Show download progress percentage during installation
2. **Ollama/SD Installation**: Implement actual installation for Ollama and Stable Diffusion (currently directs to Download Center)
3. **Size Estimates**: Show expected download size and disk space required
4. **Time Estimates**: Display estimated installation time
5. **Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel in-progress installations
6. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with fallback mirrors on failure

## Conclusion

The first-run wizard now provides a significantly better experience:
- ✅ Actually installs components instead of simulating
- ✅ Shows where components will be/are installed
- ✅ Provides clear guidance and options
- ✅ Gives helpful feedback during and after installation
- ✅ Properly detects installation status
- ✅ Shows clear error messages when things go wrong

This addresses all the issues mentioned in the original problem statement and provides a solid foundation for onboarding new users.
